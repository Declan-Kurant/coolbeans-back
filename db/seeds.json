Atitlan -  has a very rich soil composition thanks to the volcanoes that surround Lake Atitlan. The windy and wet climate contribute to the nutty, chocolate characteristics that are balanced by a lemony acid and some florals. Huehuetenango - probably the most famous (and difficult to pronounce—it is generally said “way-way-ten-AN-go”). Crisp malic and citrus acidity, full body, and toffee sweetness mark these coffees, which tend to be the most fruit-forward and can be the most complex of what Guatemala has to offer. Nuevo Oriente -  a small region to the eastern edge of the country, butting up against the Honduran border. Its climate is cloudier and rainier than some of the other regions, and the relatively stable temperatures and limited sunlight create a full-bodied coffee with loads of balance.",

			"What makes Vietnamese coffee distinct? Vietnamese coffee is almost always Robusta, while the usual coffee bean is Arabica. Robusta is almost twice as strong caffeine wise, making it a bit more bitter, as caffeine itself is bitter. Furthermore, it has 60% less lipid (fat) and sugar than Arabica, so the taste is sharp and less casual than your usual cup of coffee. Unlike Arabica, which is mellow and easy-drinking, Robusta is often compared to burnt tires and rubbery in taste with a thick lingering taste and higher acidity. While this might turn away the head of a serial Starbucks fan, for many Vietnamese, only the strength of Robusta is the way to go. ",
