# CoolBeans- BackEnd

Hello! This is the back-end API for CoolBeans, an interactive coffee registry that allows users to read up on different coffees from around the world, read resources on how coffee is designated and categorized, and discover new coffees based on old preferences!

# Process & developing

Our team --- Sarah, Declan, & Michael --- actively worked together to develop the back-end. Each team member was responsible for doing research on coffee from a specific geographic region (The Americas, Africa, & India & The Pacific). Our seed file was compiled jointly, and the routes and installations were done together.

This back-end is in Express with a MongoDB database, using Mongoose to communicate between the two. The packages installed and required throughout the app were managed with NPM.
